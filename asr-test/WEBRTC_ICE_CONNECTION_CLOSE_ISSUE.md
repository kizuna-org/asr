# WebRTC ICE Connection Closing Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Summary

The realtime audio streaming feature consistently fails because the WebRTC ICE
connection closes immediately after starting the audio puller threads,
preventing any audio frames from being captured.

## Observable Symptoms

```
[FRONTEND] üéôÔ∏è Audio puller thread started!
[FRONTEND] WebRTC state: WebRtcStreamerState(playing=True, signalling=False)
[FRONTEND] Has receiver: True
[FRONTEND] Running event is set: True
[FRONTEND] üîÑ Entering while loop...
[FRONTEND] üîÑ First loop iteration! rtc_ctx.state.playing = True
ICE connection state is closed  ‚Üê **IMMEDIATE FAILURE**
```

## Root Cause: Streamlit Rerun Cycle

### The Execution Flow

1. User clicks "„É™„Ç¢„É´„Çø„Ç§„É†ÈñãÂßã" button
2. `start_btn` returns `True` (current render cycle)
3. Thread initialization code executes
4. Threads start successfully
5. **Script completes ‚Üí Streamlit AUTOMATICALLY RERUNS**
6. During rerun: `webrtc_streamer(key="asr-audio", ...)` is called again
7. WebRTC component state changes ‚Üí **ICE connection closes**

### Why ICE Closes

The `webrtc_streamer` component is called on EVERY Streamlit render:

```python
# Line ~1178 - executed on EVERY rerun!
rtc_ctx = webrtc_streamer(
    key="asr-audio",
    mode=WebRtcMode.SENDONLY,
    ...
)
```

When Streamlit reruns after the button click:

- The component is recreated (even with the same `key`)
- ICE renegotiation might occur
- Some internal state changes cause the connection to close
- This happens BEFORE audio frames can be captured

## Failed Attempted Solutions

### 1. ‚ùå Threading.Event for Cross-Thread Communication

**What we tried:** Replaced `st.session_state` with `threading.Event` for thread
synchronization **Result:** Fixed the premature stop issue, but ICE still closes
**Why it failed:** This was solving a different problem (thread communication),
not the rerun issue

### 2. ‚ùå Removed All Debug st.write() Calls

**What we tried:** Removed `st.write()` calls after thread creation **Result:**
ICE still closes **Why it failed:** The automatic rerun after button click is
unavoidable

### 3. ‚ùå Immediate Thread Start in Button Handler

**What we tried:** Moved thread initialization directly into the `if start_btn:`
block **Result:** ICE still closes **Why it failed:** Streamlit ALWAYS reruns
after a button click completes

## Potential Solutions

### Option A: Prevent Rerun After Starting Threads ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

Explicitly stop Streamlit from rerunning after starting threads:

```python
if start_btn:
    # ... validate conditions ...
    # Start threads
    send_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)
    st.session_state["realtime_running"] = True
    # ... initialize everything ...

    # Start threads
    t.start()
    p.start()

    # CRITICAL: Stop execution here, don't let Streamlit rerun!
    st.stop()  # or sys.exit(0)
```

**Pros:**

- Prevents the automatic rerun that destroys WebRTC
- Threads continue running
- WebRTC component stays alive

**Cons:**

- UI won't update to show "streaming in progress"
- User won't see the `st.info()` message
- Might need manual rerun later to update UI

### Option B: Use Button Callback (on_click)

Move thread initialization to a callback function:

```python
def start_realtime_streaming():
    # This runs BEFORE the rerun
    send_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)
    # ... start threads ...

start_btn = st.button(
    "„É™„Ç¢„É´„Çø„Ç§„É†ÈñãÂßã",
    on_click=start_realtime_streaming,  # Callback runs first!
    disabled=not can_start
)
```

**Pros:**

- Callback executes before rerun
- Might preserve WebRTC state better

**Cons:**

- Still unclear if this prevents ICE close
- Callbacks have limitations (can't access local variables)

### Option C: Conditional WebRTC Component Rendering

Only render `webrtc_streamer` when NOT streaming:

```python
if not st.session_state.get("realtime_running", False):
    rtc_ctx = webrtc_streamer(...)
    st.session_state["_rtc_ctx"] = rtc_ctx
else:
    rtc_ctx = st.session_state.get("_rtc_ctx")
```

**Pros:**

- Prevents component recreation during streaming

**Cons:**

- May not work - session state might not preserve WebRTC context
- Component might need to be rendered every time

### Option D: Use st.experimental_fragment (Streamlit 1.33+)

Isolate the WebRTC component in a fragment that doesn't rerun:

```python
@st.experimental_fragment
def webrtc_component():
    return webrtc_streamer(...)

rtc_ctx = webrtc_component()
```

**Pros:**

- Modern Streamlit approach
- Component stays stable across reruns

**Cons:**

- Requires newer Streamlit version
- May have compatibility issues with streamlit-webrtc

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **IMMEDIATE FIX:** Try Option A (`st.stop()` after starting threads)
2. **IF THAT FAILS:** Try Option B (callback approach)
3. **LONG-TERM:** Consider Option D if upgrading Streamlit

## Key Learning

**The fundamental problem is Streamlit's execution model: ANY UI interaction
triggers a full script rerun, which recreates ALL components, including WebRTC.
This is incompatible with maintaining a persistent WebRTC connection while also
updating the UI.**

The solution MUST either:

- Prevent reruns entirely (Option A)
- Isolate WebRTC from reruns (Option C/D)
- Or fundamentally restructure the app architecture
