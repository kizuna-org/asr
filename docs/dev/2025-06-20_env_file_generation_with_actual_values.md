# Environment File Generation with Actual Values

Date: 2025-06-20

## Overview

This document describes the change to generate the `.env` file with actual values from Terraform resources rather than template variables. This ensures that the environment variables contain the actual values of resources created by Terraform, such as the R2 bucket name.

## Changes Made

1. Modified the subscriber `.env` file generation to use the actual R2 bucket name from the created resource
2. Added a new Terraform resource to generate the root `.env` file with actual values
3. Removed the manually created `.env` file since it will now be generated by Terraform

## Rationale

Using the actual resource values in the environment files ensures consistency between the infrastructure created by Terraform and the configuration used by the application. This prevents issues that could arise from mismatches between the intended configuration and the actual resources.

## Implementation Details

The `.env` file is now generated using the `local_file` resource in Terraform, which includes:

- GCP configuration with project ID and subscription names
- Path to the GCP service account key file
- Cloudflare R2 configuration with the actual bucket name from the created resource
- Hugging Face token

The key change is using `${cloudflare_r2_bucket.app_bucket.name}` instead of `${local.r2_bucket_name}` to ensure the actual bucket name is used.

## Usage

After running `terraform apply`, the `.env` file will be automatically generated with the actual values of the created resources. This file can then be used by the application to connect to the correct resources.

If you need to manually create or modify the `.env` file, you should do so after running Terraform to ensure you have the correct resource values.
