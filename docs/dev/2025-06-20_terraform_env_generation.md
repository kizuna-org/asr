# Terraform Environment File Generation

Date: 2025-06-20

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of automatic `.env` file generation and GCP service account key placement for the subscriber application using Terraform.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Environment File Generation**:
   - Modified Terraform to generate a `.env` file directly in the subscriber application directory
   - Added configuration to save the GCP service account JSON key in the same location
   - Updated the Terraform configuration to include all necessary environment variables

2. **Updated Subscriber Application**:
   - Modified the Dockerfile to include python-dotenv package
   - Updated the subscriber.py script to load environment variables from the `.env` file
   - Created a config directory structure to store both the `.env` file and service account key

3. **Updated Terraform Configuration**:
   - Added new local variables for R2 and Hugging Face configuration
   - Added a null_resource to ensure the config directory exists
   - Created local_file resources to generate both the service account key and `.env` file

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment**:
   - No manual creation of `.env` files required
   - Service account keys are automatically placed in the correct location
   - All configuration is managed through Terraform

2. **Improved Security**:
   - Sensitive configuration is managed through Terraform
   - Service account keys are stored in a consistent location
   - Environment variables are properly isolated

3. **Reduced Configuration Errors**:
   - Consistent environment variable names
   - Automatic generation prevents typos or missing variables
   - Clear documentation of required configuration

## Usage

1. Update the local variables in `infrastructure/terraform/locals.tf` with your actual values:
   ```terraform
   # R2 Configuration
   r2_endpoint_url = "https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
   r2_access_key_id = "your-r2-access-key-id"
   r2_secret_access_key = "your-r2-secret-key"
   r2_bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"

   # Hugging Face Configuration
   hf_token = "your-huggingface-token"
   ```

2. Run Terraform to generate the files:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. The `.env` file and service account key will be generated in the `whaled/app/config/` directory.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider encrypting sensitive values in the Terraform state
2. Add validation for required environment variables
3. Implement rotation of service account keys
