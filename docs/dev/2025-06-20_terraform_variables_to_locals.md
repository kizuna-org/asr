# Terraform Variables to Locals Migration

## Summary

All Terraform variables have been migrated to locals.tf, and GitHub token creation has been moved into Terraform itself using the `github_actions_pat` resource.

## Changes Made

1. Removed `variables.tf` file completely
2. Updated `locals.tf` to include all configuration values:
   - Added `environment = "prod"` (previously a variable)
   - Added `github_owner = "kizuna-org"` for GitHub provider
3. Added GitHub PAT creation in `main.tf`:
   ```terraform
   resource "github_actions_pat" "cicd_token" {
     name             = "terraform-managed-cicd-token"
     repository       = "chumchat"
     selected_repositories = ["chumchat"]
     permissions {
       contents = "read"
       packages = "read"
     }
     expiration = "2030-01-01"
   }
   ```
4. Updated GitHub provider to use the Terraform-created token:
   ```terraform
   provider "github" {
     token = github_actions_pat.cicd_token.token
     owner = local.github_owner
   }
   ```
5. Updated `terraform.tfvars.example` to reflect that variables are no longer needed

## Benefits

1. Simplified configuration - all settings are in one place (locals.tf)
2. No need for external GitHub token - Terraform manages token creation
3. Improved security - no need to store sensitive tokens in terraform.tfvars
4. Streamlined deployment - no need to create and manage terraform.tfvars file

## Deployment Notes

Since all variables have been moved to locals and the GitHub token is now created by Terraform, there's no need for a terraform.tfvars file. Simply run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
