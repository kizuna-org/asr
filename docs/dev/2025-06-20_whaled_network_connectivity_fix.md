# Whaled App Subscriber Network Connectivity Fix

## Issue
The whaled app subscriber was encountering network connectivity issues when attempting to install the `google-cloud-pubsub` package. The error message indicated that the container couldn't establish a connection to PyPI:

```
WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7a40f628cdd0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable')': /simple/google-cloud-pubsub/
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by network connectivity problems within the Docker container. This could be due to:
1. DNS resolution issues
2. Network configuration problems
3. Temporary network outages
4. Container networking setup

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Dockerfile Network Configuration**:
   - Added multiple DNS servers (Google's 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 and Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1)
   - Configured Docker daemon DNS settings
   - Added DNS resolver options for better reliability
   - Installed additional network diagnostic tools (curl, dnsutils, iputils-ping, net-tools)
   - Added comprehensive network connectivity checks before pip installation

2. **Improved Package Installation Resilience**:
   - Added multiple PyPI mirrors for redundancy
   - Increased pip timeout and retry values
   - Pinned package versions to avoid compatibility issues
   - Added explicit network connectivity checks before installation

3. **Enhanced Subscriber Network Resilience**:
   - Added network connectivity checks during initialization
   - Configured PubSub client with retry settings
   - Added proper error handling for network-related issues
   - Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism for Pub/Sub connection issues

## Testing
These changes make the container more resilient to temporary network issues during both build time and runtime. The container will now:
1. Try multiple DNS servers if one fails
2. Use multiple PyPI mirrors if the primary one is unreachable
3. Perform connectivity checks and report issues
4. Automatically retry connections with exponential backoff

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a health check endpoint to monitor the subscriber's connectivity status
- Evaluate using a more robust service mesh or networking solution if network issues persist
- Add monitoring and alerting for network connectivity issues
