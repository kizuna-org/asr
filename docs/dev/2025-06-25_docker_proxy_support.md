# Docker Proxy Support Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Status**: Completed (resumed after interruption, finalized)

## Overview

Added HTTP and HTTPS proxy support to all Docker containers in the project to enable operation behind corporate firewalls or proxy servers. This implementation was completed in a previous session and is now being properly documented and committed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables (.env.example)

Added proxy configuration variables:
```bash
# Proxy Configuration (optional)
HTTP_PROXY=
HTTPS_PROXY=
```

### 2. Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)

Updated both services (`build-subscriber` and `app-subscriber`) to:
- Pass proxy variables as build arguments
- Set proxy environment variables at runtime

### 3. Dockerfiles

Updated all three Dockerfiles to accept and use proxy arguments:
- `app/Dockerfile`
- `whaled/app/Dockerfile`
- `whaled/build/Dockerfile`

Each Dockerfile now includes:
```dockerfile
# Accept proxy arguments
ARG HTTP_PROXY
ARG HTTPS_PROXY

# Set proxy environment variables for build
ENV HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY}
ENV HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY}
```

## Benefits

1. **Corporate Network Compatibility**: Containers can now operate behind corporate proxies
2. **Build-time Support**: Package installations during Docker build respect proxy settings
3. **Runtime Support**: Applications can make HTTP requests through proxies
4. **Optional Configuration**: Proxy settings are optional and don't affect normal operation

## Usage

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set proxy variables if needed:
   ```bash
   HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   ```
3. Build and run containers normally with `docker-compose up --build`

## Technical Details

- Proxy settings are passed as build arguments to support package installations
- Runtime environment variables ensure applications can use proxies
- Empty proxy variables are handled gracefully (no impact when not needed)
