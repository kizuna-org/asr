# Example Terraform variables file
# This file is no longer needed as all variables have been moved to locals.tf
# No terraform.tfvars file is required for deployment.

# All configuration is now defined in locals.tf:
# - project_id = "chumchat"
# - region = "asia-northeast1"
# - zone = "asia-northeast1-a"
# - environment = "prod"
# - build_topic_name = "build-triggers"
# - app_topic_name = "app-triggers"
# - build_subscription_name = "build-triggers-sub"
# - app_subscription_name = "app-triggers-sub"
# - service_account_name = "github-actions-cicd"
# - app_service_account_name = "app-service-account"
# - github_owner = "kizuna-org"

# GitHub token is now created by Terraform using the github_actions_pat resource
