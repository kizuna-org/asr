# Example Terraform variables file
# This file is no longer needed as all variables have been moved to locals.tf
# No terraform.tfvars file is required for deployment.

# All configuration is now defined in locals.tf:
# - project_id = "chumchat"
# - region = "asia-northeast1"
# - zone = "asia-northeast1-a"
# - environment = "prod"
# - build_topic_name = "build-triggers"
# - app_topic_name = "app-triggers"
# - build_subscription_name = "build-triggers-sub"
# - app_subscription_name = "app-triggers-sub"
# - service_account_name = "github-actions-cicd"
# - app_service_account_name = "app-service-account"
# - github_owner = "kizuna-org"
# - github_bootstrap_token = "your-github-token-with-admin-org-scope"

# New R2 and Hugging Face configuration:
# - r2_endpoint_url = "https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
# - r2_access_key_id = "your-r2-access-key-id"
# - r2_secret_access_key = "your-r2-secret-key"
# - r2_bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
# - hf_token = "your-huggingface-token"

# Important: You need to update the github_bootstrap_token in locals.tf with a valid
# GitHub personal access token that has admin:org permissions. This token is used
# only to create the github_actions_pat resource, which then creates a more limited
# token for ongoing use.

# After the initial bootstrap token is used to create the PAT, Terraform will use
# the created PAT for subsequent operations.
